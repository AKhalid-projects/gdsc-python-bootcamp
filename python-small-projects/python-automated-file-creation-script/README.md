# Pytomate
A script to create multiple python files with sequential numbering.
Proudly, my first ever python script!

## why?
because it is a very fast, an efficient and most importantly, a very fun way to create files for this repository without wasting time. I found that it was convenient for me but this is a hacky quick-fix sort of a solution. It will need to be tested, refactored, generalized, and updated with new features.

## How does it work?

running the script
```
python pytomate.py
```
Entering the specified parameters
```
Enter folder Path: 
D:\Projects\vs-projects\python\gdsc-python-bootcamp\python-book-exercises\chapter-12
Enter the starting number: 
1
Enter the ending number: 
11
Enter the file prefix: 
chapter-12
```


## What are the limitations?
* Does not support other file formats
* Does not handle all exception cases yet

## List of TODOs
- [ ] testing
- [ ] refactoring
- [ ] generalizing

## Future Implemintations
- [ ] the script can takes the name of the book, create folders for each chapter and files in each chapter with sequential numbering.
- [ ] support file formats other than python files
